Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) are one of the leading causes of death globally. Early detection is crucial to prevent serious health complications. This project focuses on developing a machine learning model to predict the risk of cardiovascular disease based on patient data.

The project is implemented using Google Colab, which provides an easy-to-use, cloud-based environment for coding and model training. The dataset includes features such as age, gender, blood pressure, cholesterol levels, BMI, smoking habits, and physical activity.

Data preprocessing is performed to clean and prepare the data. Several machine learning algorithms like Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, and Random Forest are applied and compared. The models are evaluated using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to find the most effective one.

The final model helps predict whether a person is at risk of cardiovascular disease, assisting healthcare providers in making early and accurate decisions.

Objectives:
Predict cardiovascular disease risk using health data.

Compare different ML models to find the best performer.

Use Google Colab for implementation and visualization.

Technologies Used:
Platform: Google Colab

Language: Python

Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn

Outcome:
A working machine learning model that predicts CVD risk, providing valuable insights for early diagnosis and better patient care.
